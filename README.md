# Proposal 
* The application would help estimate the value of a given steam account. 

* Someone who wants to get an estimate value of a steam account will use it.

* The project is very helpful and I wish to design one because I'd like to make the steam trading market more transparent.

## User stories
* As a user, I want to be able to add a game to my steam library, and specify the name, the original sell price, and the percentage of unlocked achievements

* As a user, I want to be able to view the list of games in my steam library

* As a user, I want to be able to mark a game as played in my steam library and play game

* As a user, I want to be able to mark a game as not played in my steam library

* As a user, I want to be able to see how popular a game is

* As a user, I want to be able to remove a game from my steam library

* As a user, I want to be able to see how much is my steam account

* As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my gamelist to file and have the option to do so or not

* As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my gamelist from file
